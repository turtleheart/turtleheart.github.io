TODOs:
- Write README
- License

- Sub-lists by stores
  - This wants to solve an issue where it's hard to get an overview of the items you've added if you're working on several lists at once. 
    E.g. when planning a visit to a shopping mall 
- Option to insert new items after the most recently moved item
- Autocomplete to suggest item names
- Option to "check all" items in a list

Known bugs:
- PWA not working well
