# DND 5E

The following are links to latest versions of files with DND-related content. I **strongly** recommended that you access the documents through these links instead of downloading a local copy, as the contents of the documents can and will change.

## Campaign-independent documents

*The following documents apply to any campaign or one-shot session which I GM, unless said otherwise by me.*

[Character creation guidelines](DND/Character_Creation.pdf)

The character creation document lists approved character options. Note that most campaigns will make additions and/or exceptions to this document, but it is useful as a common base.

*The class additions which were previously presented in their own document have been merged into the character creation guidelines, due to many of those features appearing in Tasha's Cauldron of Everything.*

[Downtime activities](DND/DowntimeActivities-player-version.pdf)

The downtime activities document contains *suggestions* for what your character may do during downtime.

[Dungeon exploration](DND/Dungeon_Exploration.pdf)

A document which explains what an Exploration Turn is, and how one is resolved.

# A Rasp of Sand

The following are links to the latest versions of files with A Rasp of Sand-related content.

## Character Sheets

[Character Sheet](ARoS/Character_sheet.pdf)

[Character Sheet (form-fillable)](ARoS/Character_sheet_fillable.pdf)

The character sheets are based on reddit user u/Tlazolteotll's [character sheet](https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/ay5ikp/i_made_a_simple_knave_character_sheet_in_tabletop/). They have been modified to better fit ARoS.
