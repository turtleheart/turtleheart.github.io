# DND files

The following are links to latest versions of files with DND-related content. I **strongly** recommended that you access the documents through these links instead of downloading a local copy, as the contents of the documents can and will change.

[Class additions](DND/DND_Class_Additions.pdf)

The class additions document contains some additional player character options, as well as some quality of life improvements.

[Downtime activities](DND/DowntimeActivities-player-version.pdf)

The downtime activities document contains *suggestions* for what your character may do during downtime. This is by no means an exclusive list - talk to your GM.

[Magical items prices](DND/Magical_Items_Prices.pdf)

A document containing prices for magical items. Note that the existence of an item on this list does not mean that it can be acquired - talk to your GM.
